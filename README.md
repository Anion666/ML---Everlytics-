Creating a Model that predicts whether a webiste is a PHISING website or not 


Justification of the selected approach 

The approach that I have used for this project depended on what kind of data set I was using and what problem I am supposed to solve here. Talking about the problem statement its clear that we need to identify whether a given website is a phising website or not based on the feature data set provided to us.

I have used Logistical Regression as the supervised learning technique for this particular project for the following reasons:

--> We need to classify if it is a phising webiste or not. So we bascially need to predict the outcome as a YES or NO.

--> Logistical Regression helps us identify and indicate the likelihood of whether the website will be a phising website or not.

--> It works on probability and can give a clear indication when we are trying to solve a problem where we need to classify things ( In this case phising or not phising )


Visualizations Used: I have used visualization techniques using seaborn and plotly for correlation dataframes to get a better understanding. 





Tools Used: 

Pandas- For Data manipulation 

Numpy- mathematical calculations 

Seaborn and Plotly- Data Visulization 

Scikit Learn- Training the model
